Tree: Depth First Search:
===================

    Tree Depth First Search (DFS) is an algorithm used for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
    The goal is to explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
    DFS is implemented using a stack, either implicitly with recursion or explicitly with an iterative approach.
    Here's an overview of how DFS works on a tree:

    * Steps of DFS in a Tree:
    -------------------------

    - Start at the Root: Begin the search at the root node of the tree.
    - Explore Each Branch Fully:
        * Visit a node.
        * Recursively (or iteratively) explore each of its children one by one.
        * Continue this process until you reach a leaf node (a node with no children).
    - Backtrack: Once a leaf node or a node with no unvisited children is reached, backtrack to the previous node
        and continue the search from there.
    - Repeat Until All Nodes are Visited: The process repeats until all nodes in the tree have been visited.

    * Types of DFS Traversals:
    --------------------------

        - Pre-order Traversal:

            Visit the current node.
            Traverse the left subtree.
            Traverse the right subtree.

        Pre-order (Root, Left, Right)

        - In-order Traversal:

            Traverse the left subtree.
            Visit the current node.
            Traverse the right subtree.

        In-order (Left, Root, Right)

        - Post-order Traversal:

            Traverse the left subtree.
            Traverse the right subtree.
            Visit the current node.

        Post-order (Left, Right, Root)

    Example:
    --------

        Consider the following binary tree:

               A
              / \
             B   C
            / \   \
           D   E   F

        - Pre-order Traversal:

            Visit A
            Visit B
            Visit D
            Visit E
            Visit C
            Visit F

        Result: A, B, D, E, C, F

        - In-order Traversal:

            Visit D
            Visit B
            Visit E
            Visit A
            Visit C
            Visit F

        Result: D, B, E, A, C, F

        - Post-order Traversal:

            Visit D
            Visit E
            Visit B
            Visit F
            Visit C
            Visit A

        Result: D, E, B, F, C, A

    * Java implementation of Depth First Search (DFS) for a tree using recursion:
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        - This example includes pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals.

        - First, define the `Node` class to represent each node in the tree.

        class Node {
            String value;
            Node left, right;

            public Node(String item) {
                value = item;
                left = right = null;
            }
        }

        - Now, implement the DFS traversals: pre-order, in-order, and post-order.

        public class DFSTree {
            Node root;

            // Pre-order traversal (Root, Left, Right)
            void dfsPreOrder(Node node) {
                if (node == null) {
                    return;
                }
                // Visit the root
                System.out.print(node.value + " ");
                // Traverse the left subtree
                dfsPreOrder(node.left);
                // Traverse the right subtree
                dfsPreOrder(node.right);
            }

            // In-order traversal (Left, Root, Right)
            void dfsInOrder(Node node) {
                if (node == null) {
                    return;
                }
                // Traverse the left subtree
                dfsInOrder(node.left);
                // Visit the root
                System.out.print(node.value + " ");
                // Traverse the right subtree
                dfsInOrder(node.right);
            }

            // Post-order traversal (Left, Right, Root)
            void dfsPostOrder(Node node) {
                if (node == null) {
                    return;
                }
                // Traverse the left subtree
                dfsPostOrder(node.left);
                // Traverse the right subtree
                dfsPostOrder(node.right);
                // Visit the root
                System.out.print(node.value + " ");
            }

            public static void main(String[] args) {
                DFSTree tree = new DFSTree();

                tree.root = new Node("A");
                tree.root.left = new Node("B");
                tree.root.right = new Node("C");
                tree.root.left.left = new Node("D");
                tree.root.left.right = new Node("E");
                tree.root.right.right = new Node("F");

                System.out.println("Pre-order traversal:");
                tree.dfsPreOrder(tree.root);

                System.out.println("\nIn-order traversal:");
                tree.dfsInOrder(tree.root);

                System.out.println("\nPost-order traversal:");
                tree.dfsPostOrder(tree.root);
            }
        }

    * Explanation:
    --------------

        1. Node Class: Defines a simple node structure with a value and pointers to the left and right children.
        2. DFSTree Class:
            - dfsPreOrder(Node node): Implements the pre-order traversal (Root, Left, Right).
            - dfsInOrder(Node node): Implements the in-order traversal (Left, Root, Right).
            - dfsPostOrder(Node node): Implements the post-order traversal (Left, Right, Root).
        3. main Method: Creates a tree and demonstrates the three types of DFS traversals.

    * Usage:
    --------

    When you run this code, it will output the traversal of the tree defined in the `main` method:

        - Pre-order traversal:
        A B D E C F

        - In-order traversal:
        D B E A C F

        - Post-order traversal:
        D E B F C A

    This example illustrates the basic structure and recursive nature of the DFS algorithm for tree traversal in Java.

    Use Cases of DFS

        - Solving puzzles: Such as mazes where each path is explored fully before backtracking.
        - Topological sorting: Used in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to order tasks.
        - Cycle detection: In graphs.
        - Pathfinding: In games or applications where all possible paths need to be explored.

    DFS is a foundational algorithm in computer science, offering a method to explore all nodes and paths in a tree or
    graph systematically.

Tree: Depth First Search Example LeetCode Question: 669. Trim a Binary Search Tree
=======================================================================================================================

    To trim a binary search tree (BST) such that all its elements lie within the given range `[low, high]`, you can use
    a recursive approach. The idea is to recursively adjust the tree such that any node with a value less than `low` is
    replaced by its right subtree, and any node with a value greater than `high` is replaced by its left subtree.
    Nodes within the range are kept, and their subtrees are recursively trimmed (ChatGPT coded the solution 🤖).

    * Java Implementation:
    ----------------------

        ** TreeNode Definition

        First, define the `TreeNode` class:

        class TreeNode {
            int val;
            TreeNode left;
            TreeNode right;
            TreeNode(int x) {
                val = x;
            }
        }

        ** Trimming Function

        Now, write the function to trim the BST:

        public class Solution {
            public TreeNode trimBST(TreeNode root, int low, int high) {
                if (root == null) return null;

                // If the current node's value is less than low, trim the left subtree
                if (root.val < low) {
                    return trimBST(root.right, low, high);
                }

                // If the current node's value is greater than high, trim the right subtree
                if (root.val > high) {
                    return trimBST(root.left, low, high);
                }

                // Otherwise, recursively trim the left and right subtrees
                root.left = trimBST(root.left, low, high);
                root.right = trimBST(root.right, low, high);

                return root;
            }
        }

        ** Explanation

            1. Base Case:
               - If the current node is `null`, return `null`.

            2. Current Node Value Comparison:
               - If the current node's value is less than `low`, all nodes in the left subtree are also less than `low`.
                    Hence, trim the left subtree by returning the result of `trimBST(root.right, low, high)`.
               - If the current node's value is greater than `high`, all nodes in the right subtree are also greater than
                    `high`. Hence, trim the right subtree by returning the result of `trimBST(root.left, low, high)`.

            3. Recursive Trimming:
               - For nodes within the range `[low, high]`, recursively trim both left and right subtrees and attach
               them back to the current node.

        ** Time and Space Complexity

        - Time Complexity: O(N)
          - The algorithm visits each node exactly once. In the worst case, all nodes are visited, leading to a time
          complexity of O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the BST.

        - Space Complexity: O(H)
          - The space complexity is primarily due to the recursion stack. In the worst case, the depth of the recursion
            stack will be equal to the height of the tree. For a balanced tree, this height will be O(log N), but in the
            worst case of a skewed tree, the height will be O(N). Therefore, the space complexity is O(H), where H is the
            height of the tree.

        This approach ensures that the trimmed binary search tree maintains the relative structure of the elements, with
        nodes only being removed if they fall outside the specified range.




what are some applications of finding the paths in a tree
Finding paths within a tree structure is a fundamental operation in computer science and has numerous real-world applications across various domains.

Here are several applications of finding paths in a tree:
1. File System Navigation and Search
File systems are often structured as trees (directories as nodes, files as leaves). Finding paths is essential for:
File Location: Determining the absolute path from the root directory to a specific file (e.g., /Users/Admin/Documents/file.txt).
Searching: Algorithms like file explorers use depth-first or breadth-first searches (which trace paths) to find files matching specific criteria within a directory structure.
2. Network Routing and Data Transmission
Data networks, including the internet, can be modeled as graphs or trees where finding efficient paths is critical:
Shortest Path Calculation: Routing protocols use algorithms (often variations of BFS or DFS depending on the network model) to find the quickest path for data packets to travel from a source computer to a destination server.
Network Broadcasting: In specific network configurations, algorithms are used to determine paths to broadcast information to all nodes in the most efficient manner.
3. Artificial Intelligence and Game Theory
Tree structures are extensively used in AI to represent choices and outcomes:
Game Trees: In games like Chess or Tic-Tac-Toe, every possible sequence of moves is represented as a path in a decision tree. Path-finding algorithms (like Minimax) are used to explore these paths and determine the optimal move sequence for winning the game.
Decision Making: Expert systems use decision trees to trace a path from an initial question to a final recommendation based on user input.
4. Compilers and Programming Languages
Compilers use tree structures to understand and process code:
Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs): Source code is converted into an AST. Compilers traverse paths in this tree to check for syntax errors, optimize code, and generate machine code. Finding specific patterns or paths within the AST is a core component of static code analysis tools.
5. Website Navigation and UI Design
The structure of a website is typically hierarchical:
Sitemaps: A sitemap is a tree representation of all pages. Path finding determines the navigation links and "breadcrumbs" shown to users, illustrating their location relative to the homepage (e.g., Home > Products > Category > Item).
Menu Structures: Hierarchical dropdown menus rely on traversing the structural paths of the site architecture.
6. Biological and Scientific Modeling
Phylogenetic Trees: In biology, these trees illustrate evolutionary relationships. Path-finding algorithms help determine the common ancestor between species or calculate the evolutionary distance (path length) between them.
Chemical Structures: Some molecular structures can be modeled as trees, and path finding helps analyze connectivity and properties.
