To solve LeetCode problems effectively for technical interviews in 2026, you should follow a structured approach that moves from understanding to optimization and pattern recognition.

1. The Systematic Solving Process

When you open a new problem, follow these sequential steps to ensure clarity and avoid common pitfalls:

-   **Deep Analysis:** Read the problem statement at least twice. Pay close attention to constraints (e.g., 10 ^5
    
    inputs often require 𝑂(𝑛log𝑛)
    
    or better) and expected output types.
-   **Manual Walkthrough:** Use pen and paper to dry-run small examples. This helps identify edge cases (empty inputs, single elements, duplicates) before you write any code.
-   **Brute-Force First:** Implement a naive solution first to establish a baseline. Do not worry about efficiency at this stage; just ensure it works for simple cases.
-   **Optimize Step-by-Step:** Identify bottlenecks (e.g., nested loops) and apply relevant data structures (HashMaps, Heaps) or algorithms (Binary Search, Two Pointers) to improve time and space complexity.
-   **Pseudo-code:** Write out your logic in plain English or pseudo-code before diving into the actual syntax.
2. Pattern-Based Learning

Instead of solving random problems, focus on mastering common "coding patterns" that solve large classes of problems:

-   **Two Pointers:**  Ideal for sorted arrays or searching for pairs.
-   **Sliding Window:**  Used for subarray or substring problems where you need to track a range of elements.
-   **BFS/DFS:**  Essential for tree and graph traversals; use BFS for shortest paths and DFS for exploring all branches.
-   **Dynamic Programming (DP):**  Used when a problem can be broken into overlapping subproblems, such as finding the "number of ways" to do something.

3. Study Strategy & Time Management

To avoid burnout and ensure retention, manage your study sessions strictly:

-   **The 30-Minute Rule:**  Allocate 20–30 minutes to solve the problem on your own. If you are still stuck after that, stop and read the "Discuss" section or the official solution.
-   **Quality over Quantity:**  It is better to deeply understand 50 problems and their patterns than to skim through 200 solutions.
-   **Active Revision:**  Keep a "problem log" or progress sheet. Revisit difficult problems a week later to see if you can solve them without hints.
-   **Leverage Top Solutions:**  After your solution is accepted, study the highest-rated submissions in the "Discuss" tab to learn more efficient or "cleaner" coding styles
